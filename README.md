## Web scraping scripts

There's only one script thus far, but this repo is where I'll be putting web
 scraping scripts.
 
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cleantech100.py | Scrapes i3's [Global Cleantech 100 list](https://i3connect.com/gct100/the-list).<br/><br/>This script puts Cleantech 100 companies and their details into a single CSV file for easier exploration without having to click through 100 pages (one page for each company). |
